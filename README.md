### Why this rocks:
- **Table layout** keeps everything aligned and neat
- Bold platform names with relevant **emojis** for quick visual scanning
- Large **badge buttons** as clear clickable CTAs
- Tooltips on hover to explain exactly what clicking does
- Clean minimalistic design that looks professional on any screen

---

Want me to create a **horizontal version with icon + text inline**, or maybe a **two-column grid**?  
Or even a **custom badge color scheme** to match your personal brand?

Just say the word, Surgeon!
